| 3 | Fear & Greed Index hit 5 on Feb 6 -- all-time low | Yahoo Finance, CoinDesk, CCN all confirm F&G hit 5, an all-time record low. Previous low was 6 during Terra/Luna (Jun 2022). | **VERIFIED** | However, evidence.md says it hit 5 on Feb 6 but also says "9 reading" on Feb 5 in one CoinDesk headline.

## CRITICAL ERRORS FOUND (Requiring Site-Builder Attention)

### Error 1: MicroStrategy/Strategy BTC Holdings
- **File:** insider-analysis.md, Part 7 "Key Data Points"
- **Claim:** "Strategy (Saylor) BTC Holdings: ~500,000+ BTC"
- **Actual:** 714,644 BTC as of Feb 9, 2026
- **Severity:** HIGH -- significantly understates holdings by ~214,000 BTC
- **Fix:** Change to "~714,644 BTC"

### Error 2: Larry Fink Davos Quote Attribution
- **File:** insider-analysis.md, Part 1
- **Claim:** "Davos 2026" for the $700,000 prediction
- **Actual:** The $700K prediction was made at Davos **January 2025**, not 2026
- **Severity:** MEDIUM -- incorrect date attribution
- **Fix:** Change "Davos 2026" to "Davos, January 2025"

### Error 3: Bybit Hack Amount
- **File:** market-analysis.md, Section 8
- **Claim:** "Bybit hack ($1.4B, Feb 2025)"
- **Actual:** FBI officially reports $1.5 billion. Multiple sources use both $1.4B and $1.5B.
- **Severity:** LOW -- common variance in reporting, but FBI figure is $1.5B
- **Fix:** Change to "$1.4-$1.5B" or use the FBI figure of "$1.5B"

## SUMMARY

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total claims verified | 52 |
| VERIFIED | 35 (67%) |
| PARTIALLY VERIFIED | 14 (27%) |
| INCORRECT | 3 (6%) |
| UNVERIFIABLE | 0 (0%) |

### Overall Assessment

The research files are **highly accurate** overall. The vast majority of price data, dates, quotes, percentages, and analyst predictions are confirmed by multiple independent sources. The three errors found are:

1. A significant numerical error (MicroStrategy holdings: 500K vs 714K)
2. A date attribution error (Fink Davos 2025 vs 2026)
3. A minor variance in hack reporting ($1.4B vs $1.5B FBI figure)

All other major claims -- BTC ATH, flash crash price, Fear & Greed record low, ETF outflows, halving dates, cycle peaks, Fed rate decisions, Warsh nomination, GENIUS Act details, analyst predictions, and on-chain metrics -- are verified as accurate.
