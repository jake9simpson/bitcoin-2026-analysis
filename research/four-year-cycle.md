# Bitcoin 4-Year Halving Cycle Framework

## Verified Research Document
Last updated: February 16, 2026

## The Core Thesis

Bitcoin follows a roughly 4-year market cycle anchored to the halving event, where block rewards are cut in half approximately every 210,000 blocks (~4 years). Each cycle follows a consistent pattern:

| Year in Cycle | Phase | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | **Halving Year** | Supply shock begins, early accumulation, moderate gains |
| Year 2 | **Post-Halving Year** | Parabolic bull run, cycle top typically in Q4 (Nov/Dec) |
| Year 3 | **Bear Year** | Major correction (70-85% drawdown from top) |
| Year 4 | **Recovery/Accumulation** | Bottom formation, sideways, smart money accumulates |

**Key insight:** There are generally ~3 bullish years and 1 severe bear year per cycle. The bear year is the **midterm year** (year 3 of the cycle, which is 2 years after the halving).

## Critical Observations

### 1. Tops Consistently Occur in Post-Halving Year
All four cycle tops occurred in the year after the halving:
- Cycle 1: Halving Nov 2012 -> Top Nov 2013 (368 days)
- Cycle 2: Halving Jul 2016 -> Top Dec 2017 (525 days)
- Cycle 3: Halving May 2020 -> Top Nov 2021 (549 days)
- Cycle 4: Halving Apr 2024 -> Top Oct 2025 (536 days)

**Average days from halving to top: ~495 days (~16.5 months)**

Previous three cycles all topped in Q4 (Nov/Dec). Cycle 4 also topped in Q4 but slightly earlier (Oct 6).

### 2. Bear Year is Consistently Year 3 of the Cycle
- Cycle 1: 2014 (year after 2013 top)
- Cycle 2: 2018 (year after 2017 top)
- Cycle 3: 2022 (year after 2021 top)
- Cycle 4: **2026** (year after 2025 top) -- CURRENT

### 3. Drawdown Severity
| Cycle | Top | Bottom | Drawdown |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cycle 1 | $1,127 | $175 | -84.5% |
| Cycle 2 | $19,665 | $3,200 | -83.7% |
| Cycle 3 | $69,044 | $15,476 | -77.6% |
| Cycle 4 | $126,198 | ~$60,000 (so far) | -52.4% (so far) |

Drawdowns have been getting slightly less severe each cycle (diminishing returns / increasing maturity). Cycle 4 may not drop as severely due to institutional adoption and ETFs.

### 4. Diminishing Returns on the Upside
| Cycle | Return from Halving to Top |
|---|---|
| Cycle 1 | ~9,300% |
| Cycle 2 | ~2,925% |
| Cycle 3 | ~685% |
| Cycle 4 | ~97% |

Each cycle produces significantly lower percentage returns, consistent with Bitcoin's maturation as an asset class and increasing market cap making larger percentage moves harder.

### 5. Cycle 4 Anomalies
- **Pre-halving ATH:** Bitcoin hit a new ATH *before* the halving for the first time (March 2024), driven by spot ETF approval
- **Lower percentage gains:** Only ~97% from halving to top vs hundreds/thousands of percent in prior cycles
- **Institutional dominance:** ETFs, corporate treasuries (MicroStrategy), and sovereign funds now major buyers
- **Year-end 2025 was down:** Despite 2025 being the "bull year," Bitcoin ended the year at ~$87.5K, down ~6% for the year and ~30% below the Oct ATH

## Benjamin Cowen's Analysis (Into the Cryptoverse)

Benjamin Cowen is the most prominent analyst tracking the 4-year cycle. His key positions:

1. **Cycle confirmed:** Cowen says Bitcoin completed its post-halving cycle in Q4 2025, consistent with the pattern of Q4 peaks in 2013, 2017, and 2021
2. **2026 bear year:** Expects weakness to persist through at least H1 2026
3. **200-week SMA target:** Predicts Bitcoin will visit the 200-week simple moving average ($60,000-$70,000 range) in 2026 -- this has already been tested with the flash crash
4. **Counter-trend rallies:** Warns that bounces in 2026 are "tactical moves rather than signs of a renewed bull market"
5. **Cycle duration consistent:** The current cycle lasted roughly the same length as the two preceding ones, invalidating "supercycle" theories
6. **Macro headwinds:** Slowing economic growth combined with insufficient liquidity expansion limits upside

## Where We Are Now (February 16, 2026)

**Position in the cycle:** Early-to-mid bear year (Year 3 of Cycle 4)

**Comparison to same point in previous cycles:**
- Cycle 2: By Feb 2018 (equivalent point), BTC was at ~$8,500, about 57% below the Dec 2017 top. It continued falling to $3,200 by Dec 2018.
- Cycle 3: By Feb 2022 (equivalent point), BTC was at ~$38,000, about 45% below the Nov 2021 top. It continued falling to $15,476 by Nov 2022.
- Cycle 4: As of Feb 2026, BTC is at ~$68,600, about 46% below the Oct 2025 top. If the pattern holds, further downside is possible through year-end.

**Key levels:**
- Flash crash low: $59,000-$60,000 (Feb 5, 2026)
- 200-week SMA: ~$60,000-$70,000
- Current price: ~$68,605

**If historical drawdowns rhyme:**
- 77% drawdown (like Cycle 3): ~$29,000
- 84% drawdown (like Cycles 1-2): ~$20,200
- 50-55% drawdown (moderated by ETFs/institutions): ~$57,000-$63,000

## Framework for Chart Visualization

### Recommended Cycle Boundaries
Each cycle starts with the halving event, NOT from the previous cycle's bottom:

| Cycle | Start (Halving) | End |
|---|---|---|
| Cycle 1 | Nov 28, 2012 | Jul 8, 2016 |
| Cycle 2 | Jul 9, 2016 | May 10, 2020 |
| Cycle 3 | May 11, 2020 | Apr 18, 2024 |
| Cycle 4 | Apr 19, 2024 | ~Mar/Apr 2028 (next halving) |

### Overlay Chart Data Points
For a "cycle overlay" chart comparing performance at the same stage:

| Days After Halving | Cycle 1 Price | Cycle 2 Price | Cycle 3 Price | Cycle 4 Price |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (halving) | $12 | $650 | $8,800 | $64,000 |
| ~365 (1 year) | ~$1,000 | ~$2,500 | ~$58,000 | ~$95,000 |
| ~500 (top area) | ~$1,127 | ~$15,000 | ~$65,000 | ~$126,198 |
| ~550 (post-top) | ~$700 | ~$19,665 (top) | ~$69,044 (top) | ~$87,500 |
| ~670 (current, ~22 months) | ~$450 | ~$8,500 | ~$38,000 | ~$68,605 |

### Color Coding Suggestion
- Year 1 (Halving): Blue/Neutral
- Year 2 (Bull/Top): Green
- Year 3 (Bear): Red -- **WE ARE HERE**
- Year 4 (Recovery): Yellow/Orange
