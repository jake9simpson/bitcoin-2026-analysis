## 3. BOTTOMING INDICATORS DASHBOARD (Chart-Ready Data)

| Indicator | Current Value (Feb 2026) | Bottom Zone Threshold | Peak Zone Threshold | Current Signal | Historically Triggered at Bottom? |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| MVRV Z-Score | 0.47 | < 0.0 (green zone) | > 7.0 (red zone) | APPROACHING | Not yet - needs to go negative |
| 200-Week MA | ~$58,000 | Price touches/pierces | Price far above | APPROACHING | Price at $69K, still $11K above |
| Puell Multiple | ~0.5-0.6 (est.) | < 0.5 (green zone) | > 4.0 (red zone) | APPROACHING | Near green zone threshold |
| Pi Cycle Bottom | 150 EMA vs 471 SMA x0.475 | Crossover signal | N/A | NOT TRIGGERED | No crossover detected yet |
| 2-Year MA Multiplier | Price below 2Y MA | Price < 2Y MA (green) | Price > 2Y MA x5 (red) | TRIGGERED | Price is below 2-Year MA |
| Mayer Multiple | ~0.70-0.75 (est.) | < 0.8 | > 2.4 | TRIGGERED | Below 1.0 = accumulation zone |
| Reserve Risk | ~0.001-0.002 (est.) | < 0.0027 | > 0.02 | TRIGGERED | In favorable risk/reward zone |
| Hash Ribbons | Capitulation active | 30D SMA < 60D SMA | N/A | TRIGGERED | Miner capitulation confirmed Jan 2026 |
| Fear & Greed Index | 8-10 (Extreme Fear) | < 10 (Extreme Fear) | > 90 (Extreme Greed) | TRIGGERED | Extreme fear = historically bullish |
| NUPL (Net Unrealized P/L) | ~0.15-0.20 (est.) | < 0 (capitulation) | > 0.75 (euphoria) | APPROACHING | Not in capitulation yet |

### Indicator Summary:
- **Triggered (5/10):** 2-Year MA Multiplier, Mayer Multiple, Reserve Risk, Hash Ribbons, Fear & Greed
- **Approaching (4/10):** MVRV Z-Score, 200-Week MA, Puell Multiple, NUPL
- **Not Triggered (1/10):** Pi Cycle Bottom
- **Assessment:** 50% of key bottoming indicators triggered, 40% approaching. Historically, 70-80% trigger rate marks the definitive bottom. Current state suggests we are in the *bottoming process* but may not have reached the final low.

## 4. LOGARITHMIC REGRESSION BANDS (Chart-Ready Data)

### Current Band Levels (Approximate, Feb 2026):

| Band | Color | Label | Price Level | Current Position |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| -2 SD | Dark Blue | "Fire Sale" | ~$28,000-$32,000 | Far below |
| -1.5 SD | Blue | "Accumulate" | ~$38,000-$42,000 | Below |
| -1 SD | Indigo | "Still Cheap" | ~$50,000-$55,000 | Below |
| -0.5 SD | Green | "Undervalued" | ~$62,000-$68,000 | AT THIS LEVEL |
| Fair Value | Purple | "Fair Value" | ~$78,000-$85,000 | Above current price |
| +0.5 SD | Yellow | "HODL" | ~$100,000-$110,000 | Well above |
| +1 SD | Orange | "Caution" | ~$135,000-$150,000 | Peak was near here |
| +1.5 SD | Light Red | "Bubble?" | ~$180,000-$200,000 | Never reached |
| +2 SD | Red | "SELL!" | ~$250,000+ | Never reached |

### Key Observations:
- BTC peaked near the +1 SD band (~$126K vs. $135-150K band)
- Current price ($69K) is in the -0.5 SD "Undervalued" zone
- Fair value per log regression: ~$78,000-$85,000
- The 200-week MA ($58K) aligns closely with the -1 SD band
- Benjamin Cowen's thesis: each cycle peak is ~2.5 log regression bands below the prior peak

### Historical Peak Band Positions:
| Cycle | Peak Price | Approximate Band at Peak |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------|
| 2013 | $1,127 | +2.5 SD (deep red) |
| 2017 | $19,783 | +2.0 SD (red) |
| 2021 | $69,044 | +1.5 SD (light red) |
| 2025 | $126,198 | +1.0 SD (orange) |

This perfectly illustrates Cowen's diminishing returns thesis: each cycle peak occurs at a progressively lower standard deviation band.

## 5. BENJAMIN COWEN'S KEY FRAMEWORKS

### 5a. Diminishing Returns / ROI Decay

| Metric | Cycle 1 (2012-2013) | Cycle 2 (2016-2017) | Cycle 3 (2020-2021) | Cycle 4 (2024-2025) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Peak-to-Peak ROI | -- | +1,655% ($1.1K->$19.8K) | +249% ($19.8K->$69K) | +83% ($69K->$126K) |
| Halving-to-Peak ROI | +9,020% | +2,942% | +683% | +94% |
| Bottom-to-Peak ROI | +52,587% | +6,239% | +346% | TBD |
| Peak SD Band | +2.5 SD | +2.0 SD | +1.5 SD | +1.0 SD |

**Cowen's Thesis:** "Diminishing returns and slower cycles are defining this era." Each cycle delivers progressively smaller percentage gains as Bitcoin matures and market cap grows.

### 5b. Lengthening Cycles Theory

| Metric | Cycle 1 | Cycle 2 | Cycle 3 | Cycle 4 | Trend |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Days: Halving to Peak | 368 | 525 | 549 | 536 | Lengthening then stable |
| Days: Peak to Bottom | 410 | 365 | 376 | ~350-380 (est.) | Shortening |
| Days: Bottom to Halving | 504 | 511 | 517 | 514 | Remarkably stable (~510 days) |
| Full Cycle (Peak to Peak) | -- | 1,478 days | 1,422 days | 1,427 days (est.) | Stable (~4 years) |

**Key Insight:** While Cowen originally theorized cycles would keep lengthening, the data now shows cycle length has *stabilized* at roughly 4 years (1,420-1,480 days peak-to-peak). The lengthening occurred between Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, but Cycles 2-4 are remarkably similar in duration.

### 5c. The 50-Week Moving Average Framework

Cowen emphasizes the 50-week (350-day) moving average as a key level:
- Currently at approximately $102,000
- BTC price ($69K) is significantly below this level
- Cowen suggests a healthy market would consolidate around this level through summer 2026
- When price is below the 50W MA, it signals bearish conditions
- When price is above the 50W MA, it signals bullish conditions

## 6. STANDARD DEVIATION BAND ANALYSIS

### Bitcoin Price Position Relative to Fair Value Over Time:

| Date | BTC Price | Fair Value (Log Regression) | SD Band Position | Signal |
|------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Apr 2024 (Halving) | $64,969 | ~$65,000 | 0 SD (Fair Value) | Neutral |
| Aug 2025 (Pre-Peak) | $124,500 | ~$80,000 | +0.8 SD | Overvalued |
| Oct 2025 (Peak) | $126,198 | ~$82,000 | +1.0 SD | Overvalued |
| Dec 2025 | $82,000 | ~$83,000 | 0 SD (Fair Value) | Neutral |
| Jan 2026 | $75,000 | ~$84,000 | -0.3 SD | Slightly Undervalued |
| Feb 2026 | $69,000 | ~$85,000 | -0.5 SD | Undervalued |

### Historical Pattern:
- Bitcoin trades near fair value (~0 SD) at time of halvings
- Post-halving: 150-300 days sideways, then bull run to upper bands
- Peak occurs between +1.0 SD (2025) and +2.5 SD (2013) -- diminishing each cycle
- Bear market bottoms occur between -1.0 SD and -1.5 SD
- Current -0.5 SD position suggests more downside potential before definitive bottom

## 7. CYCLE PHASE IDENTIFICATION

### Where Are We Now? (Feb 16, 2026)

| Phase | Typical Duration | Historical Precedent | Current Status |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Post-Halving Accumulation | 150-300 days | Apr-Sep 2024 | COMPLETED |
| Bull Run / Markup | 200-350 days | Oct 2024 - Oct 2025 | COMPLETED |
| Distribution / Top | 14-45 days | Oct 2025 | COMPLETED |

| Re-Accumulation | 150-300 days | TBD (~Q4 2026-2027) | NOT YET |

### Phase Progress Bar:
```
[Accumulation] [Bull Run] [Distribution] [■■■■□□□□□□ Bear Market] [Capitulation] [Re-Accum]
                                          ~35% through bear market
                                          Day 133 of estimated ~370 days
