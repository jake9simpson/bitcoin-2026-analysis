## 2. The February 5, 2026 Flash Crash

The most dramatic single event occurred on February 5, 2026, when Bitcoin plunged 15% in a single day, briefly breaking below $61,000 to touch $60,062.

**What triggered it:**
- Cascade of forced liquidations across leveraged positions
- $1.26 billion in positions liquidated on Feb 5 alone
- Stablecoin outflows of $14 billion from Dec through Feb ($7B in one week)
- Basis trade collapse -- arbitrage spread fell below 5%, causing hedge fund unwinds
- U.S.-Iran geopolitical tensions escalation
- Surging dollar after Kevin Warsh's Fed nomination
- ETF outflows accelerating

**Comparison:** CoinDesk described it as "headed for worst one-day drawdown since FTX blowup." The Fear & Greed Index hit 5 on Feb 6 -- the lowest reading ever recorded, worse than both the Terra/Luna collapse (6) and FTX implosion (12).
